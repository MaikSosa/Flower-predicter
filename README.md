# Overview

Machine Learning has been one of the stepping stones for the development and more recent boom on Artificial Intelligence as 
we know it today. Machine Learning itself has other areas of expertise such as Calculus, Computer science and programming 
that have been around for quite some time now. All these factors or 'ingredients' have been cooking for a long time.
