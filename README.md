# Overview

Machine Learning has been one of the stepping stones for the development and more recent boom on Artificial Intelligence as 
we know it today. Machine Learning itself has other areas of expertise such as Calculus, Computer science and programming 
that have been around for quite some time now. All these factors or 'ingredients' have been cooking for a long time. 

Understanding Machine learning on paper is relatively easy if you understand the math behind it. Differently is to be able to 
code it, train it and develop it further. Nowadays, there are libraries for Python that speed up the development of a LLM. You will
still need to do some coding but the main structure and development has been already done. 

This project will help me understand, learn and create a LLM from scratch using just mathematics and python. 

Special thanks to Leonardo Flores, BYU-I professor for his mentorship and expertise.
