# Overview

Machine Learning has been one of the stepping stones for the development and more recent boom on Artificial Intelligence as 
we know it today. Machine Learning itself has other areas of expertise such as Calculus, Computer science and programming 
that have been around for quite some time now. All these factors or 'ingredients' have been cooking for a long time. 

This project features a simple Python code using multiple libraries. It features Sklearn as the LLM to read data from a
CSV file and use the data to be able to predict the specie of the flower by the size and measurements of the petals. 
Seaborn is implemented to graph results and analyze the effectiveness of the Model. 

Confusion Matrix of the model:
